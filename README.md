## Instructions

Assignment 2 For Clustering: Sessa Empirical Estimator
1. Read the Journals about the Sessa Empirical Estimator.
2. Convert the R codes into Python Codes (use jupyter notebook).
3. Using Simulated data (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00383/full) or a real world datasets of your choice (You can obtain it in Kaggle or in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), perform the Sessa Empircal Estimator and generate some insights.
4. The Sessa Empirical Estimator uses K-Means clustering (again recall the disadvantages of K-Means), try to substitute a different clustering algorithm, generate a new insight using the new clustering algorithm.
5. Compare your results between Sessa Empirical Estimator using K-Means, and Sessa Empirical Estimator using the clustering algorithm of your choice.
6. Deadline is this Sunday, Feb 23, 2025 at 11:59 pm
7. Do this with your thesis partner.
8. You can use any A.I. assistant.
